\begin{itemize}
    \item In 1911 Ramanujan published the first of his papers in the \textit {Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society}. His genius slowly gained recognition, and in 1913 he began a correspondence with the British mathematician Godfrey H. Hardy that led to a special scholarship from the University of Madras and a grant from Trinity College, Cambridge.
